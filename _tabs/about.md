I am mostly a Linux engineer with experience as a DevOps and as a software developer. After working many years as an infrastructure architect, I am mostly doing contracts now. You can find more details about my skills and my background on [https://gheo.tech](htts://gheo.tech). 

I usually work nights, wake up late and am able to function only after my coffee.

In case you would like to follow me on media platforms, or if you would like to get in touch for possible contracts, here is where you can find me:
